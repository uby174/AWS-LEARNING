This repository was made to showcase project done by me and highlight my skills

The project was to make a static website live through AWS Services
--S3 was used to host the files of the website
--Acess was configured through IAM
--Cloud Front was used to distribute the website

The project was a part of my program at Udacity cloud devops training during my internship at GOT IT solutions GmBH
